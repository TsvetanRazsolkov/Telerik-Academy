A string is an object of type String whose value is text. Internally, the text is stored as a sequential read-only collection of Char objects.
String objects are immutable: they cannot be changed after they have been created. All of the String methods and C# operators that appear to modify a string actually return the results in a new string object. 
There is no null-terminating character at the end of a C# string; therefore a C# string can contain any number of embedded null characters ('\0'). 
Strings are very similar to the char arrays (char[]), but unlike them, they cannot be modified. Like the arrays, they have properties such as Length, which returns the length of the string and allows access by index.
 Notable methods:
- Compare() - Compares two specified String objects and returns an integer that indicates their relative position in the sort order.
- Format() - Replaces one or more format items in a specified string with the string representation of a specified object.
- IndexOf() - Reports the zero-based index of the first occurrence of the specified char or string in this instance. The search can start at index 0 or at specified character position.
- LastIndexOf() - Reports the zero-based index position of the last occurrence of a specified Unicode character within this instance. The search starts at a specified character position (or the end index) and proceeds backward toward the beginning of the string.
- Join() - Concatenates the members of a constructed IEnumerable<T> collection of type String, using the specified separator between each member.
- Remove() - Returns a new string in which all the characters in the current instance, beginning at a specified position and continuing through the last position(or specified end index), have been deleted.
- Replace() - Returns a new string in which all occurrences of a specified Unicode character(or string) in this instance are replaced with another specified Unicode character(or string).
- Split() - Returns a string array that contains the substrings in this instance that are delimited by elements of a specified Unicode character array.
- Substring() - Retrieves a substring from this instance. The substring starts at a specified character position and has a specified length.
- ToCharArray() - Copies the characters in this instance to a Unicode character array.
- Trim() - Removes all leading and trailing white-space characters from the current String object.
- TrimStart(), TrimEnd() - Removes all leading and trailing white-space characters at the beginning ot the end.
- ToUpper(), ToLower() - Returns a copy of this string converted to uppercase/lowercase.
