```sql
UPDATE Groups
SET Name = 'magareta'
WHERE GroupID = 2 

UPDATE Users
SET FullName += ' Magareto'
WHERE GroupID = 2
``` 

 21. Write SQL statements to delete some of the records from the Users and Groups tables.
```sql
DELETE FROM Users
WHERE FullName LIKE '%Magareto%'

DELETE FROM Groups
WHERE Name LIKE '%magare%'
``` 

 22. Write SQL statements to insert in the Users table the names of all employees from the Employees table.
Combine the first and last names as a full name.
For username use the first letter of the first name + the last name (in lowercase).
Use the same for the password, and NULL for last login time. 
NOTE: The username is changed due to failure of the UNIQUE key constaint with the aformentioned condition.
```sql
INSERT INTO Users
	 SELECT SUBSTRING(FirstName, 0, 5) + LOWER(LastName),
	        LOWER(LEFT(FirstName, 1)) + LOWER(LastName) + 'passw',

 29. Write a SQL to create table WorkHours to store work reports for each employee (employee id, date, task, hours, comments). Don't forget to define identity, primary key and appropriate foreign key.
Issue few SQL statements to insert, update and delete of some data in the table.
Define a table WorkHoursLogs to track all changes in the WorkHours table with triggers.
For each change keep the old record data, the new record data and the command (insert / update / delete).

    **Creating the WorkHours table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE WorkHours(
	WorkHoursID int	IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	EmployeeID int FOREIGN KEY(EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(EmployeeID) NOT NULL,
	Date SMALLDATETIME NOT NULL,
	Task nvarchar(150),
	Hours int,
	Comments nvarchar(MAX)
)
```   

    **Creating WorkHoursLog table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE WorkHoursLog(
	WorkHoursLogID int	IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	Command varchar(6) NOT NULL,
	OldWorkHoursID int,
	OldEmployeeID int,
	OldDate SMALLDATETIME,
	OldTask nvarchar(150),
	OldHours int,
	OldComments nvarchar(MAX),
	NewWorkHoursID int,
	NewEmployeeID int,
	NewDate SMALLDATETIME,
	NewTask nvarchar(150),
	NewHours int,
	NewComments nvarchar(MAX),
)
```    

    **Creating INSERT trigger:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER TR_WorkHoursInsert
ON WorkHours
FOR INSERT
AS
	INSERT INTO WorkHoursLog
		SELECT 'INSERT',
			    NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 
				i.WorkHoursID, i.EmployeeID, i.Date, i.Task, i.Hours, i.Comments
		FROM inserted i
GO
```    

    **Creating UPDATE trigger:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER TR_WorkHoursUpdate
ON WorkHours
FOR UPDATE
AS
	INSERT INTO WorkHoursLog
		SELECT 'UPDATE',
			    d.WorkHoursID, d.EmployeeID, d.Date, d.Task, d.Hours, d.Comments,
				i.WorkHoursID, i.EmployeeID, i.Date, i.Task, i.Hours, i.Comments
		FROM deleted d, inserted i
GO
```    

    **Creating DELETE trigger:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER TR_WorkHoursDelete
ON WorkHours
FOR DELETE
AS
	INSERT INTO WorkHoursLog
		SELECT 'DELETE',			    
				d.WorkHoursID, d.EmployeeID, d.Date, d.Task, d.Hours, d.Comments,
				NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL 
		FROM deleted d
GO
```
   
    **Issue few SQL statements to insert, update and delete of some data in the table:**
```sql
INSERT INTO WorkHours Values
(1, GETDATE(), 'Changing the tire', 1, 'Hands are greasy.'),
(3, GETDATE(), 'Stacking up beer', 5, 'Much work, WOW.')

UPDATE WorkHours 
SET Comments += ' No joke :)'
WHERE WorkHoursID = 2; 

DELETE FROM WorkHours 
WHERE WorkHoursID = 1;
```     

 30. Start a database transaction, delete all employees from the 'Sales' department along with all dependent records from the pother tables.
At the end rollback the transaction.
```sql
BEGIN TRAN 
	ALTER TABLE Employees DROP FK_Employees_Departments
	ALTER TABLE Departments DROP FK_Departments_Employees
	DELETE FROM Employees
	FROM Employees e
	JOIN Departments d
	ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
	WHERE d.Name = 'Sales'
ROLLBACK TRAN
```    

 31. Start a database transaction and drop the table EmployeesProjects.
Now how you could restore back the lost table data? - By restoring the database from a .bak file, or from a previously exported script. 
```sql
BEGIN TRAN
	DROP TABLE EmployeesProjects
COMMIT TRAN
```   

 32. Find how to use temporary tables in SQL Server.
Using temporary tables backup all records from EmployeesProjects and restore them back after dropping and re-creating the table.

    **Create temporary table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE #TempEmployeesProjects(
	EmployeeID int NOT NULL,
	ProjectID int NOT NULL
)
```
    
	**Backup records from EmployeesProjects into temporary table:**
```sql
INSERT INTO #TempEmployeesProjects
	SELECT EmployeeID, ProjectID 
	FROM EmployeesProjects
```

	**Droping EmployeesProjects table:**
```sql
DROP TABLE EmployeesProjects
```

	**Re-creating EmployeesProjects table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE EmployeesProjects(
	EmployeeID int NOT NULL,
	ProjectID int NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT PK_EmployeesProjects PRIMARY KEY(EmployeeID, ProjectID),
	CONSTRAINT FK_EmployeeProjects_Employees FOREIGN KEY(EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(EmployeeID),
	CONSTRAINT FK_EmployeeProjects_Projects FOREIGN KEY(ProjectID) REFERENCES Projects(ProjectID)
)
```

	**Restoring records from temporary table to EmployeesProjects table:**
```sql
INSERT INTO EmployeesProjects
	SELECT EmployeeID, ProjectID 
	FROM #TempEmployeesProjects
```
